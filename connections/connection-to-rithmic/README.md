{% hint style="info" %}
Starting from May 1, the [CME exchange —Åhanged the rules for determining a professional market participant](http://yyy3.rithmic.com/?p=1069), and as a result, increased the fee for the market data. To correctly define the professional participant, Ritmic has changed the connection parameters in their platform, as well as in API for platforms such as Quantower.

To avoid additional fees for subscription to market data, a trader needs to login through the R Trader Pro platform and activate the setting in Quantower, which is called **Use RTrader**.

## Connection via RTrader Plugin Mode

Please keep in mind that connecting to Rithmic using the plugin mode requires the following steps:

* RtraderPro platform must be installed and running on your computer.
* RtraderPro platform must be enabled in the Plugin mode and use the same credentials and server as in Quantower.
* Quantower must also be enabled in the Plugin mode and use the same Rithmic credentials and server.
* The first step is to launch the RtraderPro platform with Plugin mode. Once you've successfully logged in there, you can then connect using the Quantower platform.
* Make sure your firewall is not blocking the connection from Quantower to RtraderPro.

Also, note that the Plugin Mode allows you to connect multiple different platforms simultaneously using the same Rithmic credentials.

## **How to activate Market by Order (MBO) data**

**Market by Order (MBO) data** shows the order size of an individual position inside the level2 data for a certain price. To activate the displaying of this data, open the Connection settings and tick on "**Enable 'Market by Order' (MBO) mode**".

</div>

After activation, you can see this data in the DOM Trader panel.&#x20;

Open **Settings** in the DOM trader panel -> **Columns** -> **Bids/Ask** (if you use split mode or **Bids** and **Asks** as single columns) -> **Size coloring scheme** -> **MBO.**  Also, you can set **Filter orders more than (MBO)** if you want to see orders with a certain size.
