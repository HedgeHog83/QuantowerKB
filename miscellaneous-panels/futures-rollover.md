# Futures Rollover

Traders should roll the current futures contract to avoid delivery or settlement at the contract's expiration. Rolling a contract involves closing the existing position and opening a new one in a later-dated contract, ensuring continuity in trading and managing positions more effectively while adapting to market conditions.

We offer two ways to roll over to the next futures contract (in case to keep your drawings valid on the next contract):

1. Through the **chart panel's context menu**.
2. Via the **Futures Rollover** panel.
