# Futures Rollover

Traders should roll the current futures contract to avoid delivery or settlement at the contract's expiration. Rolling a contract involves closing the existing position and opening a new one in a later-dated contract, ensuring continuity in trading and managing positions more effectively while adapting to market conditions.

We offer two ways to roll over to the next futures contract (in case to keep your drawings valid on the next contract):

1. Through the **chart panel's context menu**.
2. Via the **Futures Rollover** panel.

## How to roll to the next contract via chart

To roll over a futures contract via the chart's context menu, simply <mark style="color:green;">**right-click on the chart**</mark>, select the nearest (or desired) contract under the **Rollover** submenu, and choose how to adjust your drawings. The platform will automatically switch to the new contract and preserve the position of your drawings relative to their placement on the previous contract.
