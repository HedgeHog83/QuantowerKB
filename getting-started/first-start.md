# First start

During the first start of the Quantower platform, you will get several elements of the platform, automatically created for testing purposes:&#x20;

* [**Workspace**](https://help.quantower.com/getting-started/workspaces-binds-groups#workspaces)
* **"**[**Bind**](https://help.quantower.com/getting-started/workspaces-binds-groups#binds)**"** with several most popular trading panels
* An active **connection** — Binance Spot or DxFeed Simulated.

From this point, you can start using Quantower. Customize the workspace, open new panels. For sending trading orders you need to switch to other trading connections like [**CQG**](../connections/connection-to-cqg-amp-futures/)**,** [**Rithmic**](../connections/connection-to-rithmic/)**,** [**cTrader**](../connections/connection-to-ctrader/)**,** [**Interactive Brokers**](../connections/connect-quantower-to-interactive-broker/).&#x20;

## Quantower Free version

By default, you can use Quantower platform for free, where you have limited functionality. The list of features, that are available in the Free and Paid versions can be found on our [**License Comparison Table**](license-comparison.md).
