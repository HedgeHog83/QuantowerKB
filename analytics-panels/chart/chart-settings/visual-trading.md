# Visual Trading

The "<mark style="background-color:orange;">**Visual Trading**</mark>" setting controls the display of open position markers, orders, and executed trade markers on the chart, as well as their appearance. For ease of management, these settings are divided into subcategories:

* Positions
* Orders
* Trades
* Stop Loss
* Take Profit

The General Settings for the "<mark style="background-color:orange;">**Visual Trading**</mark>" category have just two options that define the mechanism for placing orders through Mouse Trading.

* **Trade through Order Entry.** \
  If this option is enabled, the [<mark style="background-color:orange;">**Order Entry panel**</mark>](../../../trading-panels/order-entry/) will additionally appear when placing an order through **Mouse Trading**, allowing for possible adjustment of order parameters. By default, this option is disabled.

*   **Mouse trading mode.** \
    There are two modes available for placing orders with the mouse:

    **- Single order.** In this mode, Mouse Trading will be immediately disabled after placing an order on the chart.\
    **- Multiple orders.** In this mode, Mouse Trading will remain active after placing an order on the chart until you deactivate it on the main chart toolbar. The GIF below demonstrates an example of using the Multiple Orders mode for trading via mouse.
