# Chart overlays

The **Chart Overlay** feature lets you add one or more assets (trading instruments) to an existing chart. By overlaying charts, you can clearly see relationships between different assets, such as NQ and ES or RTY. Changes in the price of one instrument may signal upcoming changes in the price of another, helping you make more informed trading decisions.

### How to Add a New Overlay

* Click the **"**<mark style="background-color:green;">**Add Overlay**</mark>**"** icon on the side toolbar.
* **Select a symbol** from the dropdown list or enter the ticker manually.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Note:** You can also add synthetic instruments as overlays. These can be created through the [**Synthetic Symbol**](../../portfolio-panels/synthetic-symbols.md) panel. For example, you can create volatility indices or spreads as additional indicators.
{% endhint %}

* Adjust the overlay's visual settings, including placement on the price scales, color, and chart style.
