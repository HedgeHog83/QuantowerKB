# Volume Impulse

The Volume Impulse indicator scans for a specific chart pattern spanning three bars. It identifies a scenario where there are two bars with increasing volume in one direction, followed by the third bar moving in the opposite direction with higher volume. This signal is a strong indicator of an impending price move in the direction of the third bar.
