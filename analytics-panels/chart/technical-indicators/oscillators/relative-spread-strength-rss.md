# Relative Spread Strength (RSS)

The Relative Spread Strength (RSS) is a modified version of the Relative Strength Index, conceived by Ian Copsey.&#x20;

The indicator functions by calculating the variance between the two moving averages. This is done by subtracting the value of the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average.
