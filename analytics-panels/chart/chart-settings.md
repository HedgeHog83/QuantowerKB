The General view of the Chart Settings menu has several sections. Let's take a closer look at them:

|                                                  |                                                        |                                                  |

The **Pnl** type allows you to choose the display of profit/loss on an open position in ticks or currency.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Pnl** type allows you to choose to display the position in currency only for those connections where this option exists.
{% endhint %}

**Show orders**. The option allows you to enable or disable the display of work orders on the chart.&#x20;

**Trade through Order entry panel**. If this option is enabled, mouse trade mode will be disabled, and when the mouse clicks on the chart, the associated order entry panel for this quote will automatically open. The mouse trade mode is the same as : clicking the right mouse button will open a panel for entering a limit order for a "Sell" deal at the marked price on the chart; click the left mouse button to open the panel for entering a limit order for a "Buy" deal at the marked price on the chart;

## Order entry

These are the settings of the order entry panel. The most interesting thing here is that you can set the standard number of entry orders which correspond to your risks. This is very convenient for manual trading.&#x20;

**Mouse trading mode**. There are two modes available to choose from:

**single order**. Once the order is set, the mouse trading mode is automatically disabled.

**multiple orders**. Mouse trading mode will be active until it is deactivated.

## Volume Bars

This tab is used to adjust the volume histogram at the bottom of the chart. You can choose the colors for the histogram that you prefer. You can also select a color scheme for coloring the chart, adjusting the color of the volume histogram based on the direction of the price bar, or changing the color depending on whether the volume is higher or lower at the moment.

## Hotkeys

This tab is for configuring your keyboard shortcuts. Here, you can configure functions like changing the volume with one button, drawing levels or trend channels, canceling orders, and many other useful functions. In general, you can assign almost any action to your preferred key combination.
