# Single Panel

Standalone panels are the minor elements of any Workspace and they behave just like any usual PC window:

* can be resized and positioned to any place on your screen;
* can stick to each other within their borders when they close enough;
* can stick its size to repeat the dimensions of other panels, while resizing;
* can be collapsed to the OS taskbar as usual windows

### Panel's context menu

Each panel has its **context menu**, located in the left upper corner, right before the Panel’s title.

This menu usually consists of the following functions:

* **Link**. Allows linking multiple panels by common symbol using the Color definition. More details are in the [_**Linking section**_](link-panels.md)**.**
* [**Create Bind**](binds.md). Combine multiple panels into a Super-panel. More details are in the [_**Binds section**_](binds.md).
* **Create Panel.** Open a new panel with the current symbol.\
  You can open the following panels: [**Order Entry**](../trading-panels/order-entry/)**,** [**Chart**](../analytics-panels/chart/)**,** [**DOM Trader**](../trading-panels/dom-trader/)**,** [**Market Depth**](../trading-panels/market-depth.md)**,** [**Time\&Sales**](../analytics-panels/time-and-sales.md)**,** [**DOM Surface**](../analytics-panels/dom-surface.md)**,** [**TPO Chart**](../analytics-panels/tpo-chart.md)**,** [**Symbol Info**](../informational-panels/symbol-info.md)
* **Duplicate Panel**. Create an exact copy of the current panel.
* [**Save as Template**](templates.md). Customize the panel, combine it in a group, or Bind and save it as a template.
* **Apply Template.** Once you created several templates you can apply any of them to this particular panel.

* [**Save as default**](set-as-default.md)**.** Each panel type comes with default settings, which you can customize to your preference. Select the “_<mark style="background-color:green;">**Set as Default**</mark>_” option, and Quantower will save your current panel's settings, applying them to each new panel of the same type.
* [**Setup Actions**](setup-actions-and-advanced-filters.md) (only for table panels like Watchlist, Time & Sales, Positions, Working Orders etc.). This feature allows you to set Alerts and implement advanced filtering in table values.
* **Always of Top.** When activated, the '_<mark style="background-color:green;">**Always On Top**</mark>_' feature keeps the active panel above all other panels. The pinned panel remains on top, even when other panels are selected.
* [**Export Data.**](../miscellaneous-panels/history-exporter.md#how-to-export-historical-data-via-other-panels) Export data from a chart or table to an external CSV file. This includes price data, indicator values, and table values. Also, you can use the [**HISTORY EXPORTER**](../miscellaneous-panels/history-exporter.md) panel.
